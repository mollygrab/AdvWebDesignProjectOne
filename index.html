  <p>The most challening part of this assignment was coding the CSS transisitons that are found on my "Favorite Books" page. I included transitions that, when activiated by hovering, change the size of the image as well as its opacity. This required a little bit of research, particulary when I was trying to figure out how to allow the images to grow larger from their center, not their bottom right corner. StackOverflow was a helpful resource in this case. I also had to play with negative widths and do a few calculations in order to make sure that the images were expanding correctly and not overlapping each other.  </p>
  <p>I also found the Skeleton grid system slightly confusing at first. While it was simple enough in class, it was a little harder to naviagate on my own. Once I was able to implement it on my "Favorite Books" page, however, it was easier to use for the rest of the site. I did take some time to try to have the image on this page share a row with the title of the page (by making each element six columns wide), I found that this wasn't working out that way that I wanted it to when the page was resized. For the sake of a more responsive page, I moved the image underneath the page's title.</p>
  <p>One part of the project that I particularly enjoyed was making the CodePen animation. When I first saw what the final result was supposed to look like, I was more than a little intimidated. But I thought making the animation was surprisingly fun and fairly easy. I ended up changing the colors of the original tutorial and also reversing the direction of the animation. </p>
  <p>If I had to improve something about my site/project, it would be the column system that I used on all of my pages. Not including the section on my favorite books, I ended up using divs that were twelve columns wide for most of the site. I feel like I could have played with the skeleton system a little more in order to come up with a more compelling layout for the project. </p>
